You can't go too wrong with minimalism. Minimal design is the default for most sites today, for both aesthetic and practical reasons. A minimal design simplifies a piece to its most essential elements, eliminating aspects that are distracting, cluttering or unimportant.
Minimalism is closely related to the concept of concision in writing.
